# Looking to the logs

While using openHAB, you may need to look at the logs generated by the software to see if there are any issues that need your attention.

Two log files are going to interest us which are `openhab.log` and `events.log`: 

- `events.log` logs everything what is happening on the Openhab event bus like sensors changing states, very useful for writing rules as you can see things changing in realtime.
- `openhab.log` shows the output of all bindings, system services and add-ons and allows you to find and understand issues with a binding or other parts of the openHAB system.

Before asking for help on the forum, it is worth checking `openhab.log` for clues as to what is causing any issues as this will result in getting help much faster.

For further details on logging, head over to [this article](https://www.openhab.org/docs/administration/logging.html) on logs and logging in general.
